- `files` ([]string) - Files can be either files or directories. An files provided here will
  be written to the root of the CD or Floppy. Directories will be written to the
  root of the CD as well, but will retain their subdirectory structure.
  For a cdrom, the behaviour is the same as `cd_files`. For floppy disks, the behaviour
  is the same as for `floppy_dirs`!

- `contents` (map[string]string) - Key/Value pairs to add to the CD or Floppy. The keys represent the paths, and the values
  represent the contents. Can be used together with `files`. If any paths are specified by
  both, `contents` will take precedence.

- `label` (string) - Label

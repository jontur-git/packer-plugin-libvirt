An external volume source defines a volume source that is external (or remote) to
the libvirt hypervisor. This usually means a cloud image or installation media
from the web or local machine. It's using go-getter under the hood with support
for HTTP, HTTPS, S3, SMB and local files. The files will be cached by Packer.

Create an image with files local to where packer runs and make it available at boot time.
Depending on the parent volume's `device` attribute, the result will be a cdrom or a floppy image.
Use this volume source scarcely, for example when the files needed as early as boot time.
In general, making local files available on the remote machine is better done with the file provisioner.
Floppies must not exceed the size 1.44MiB.

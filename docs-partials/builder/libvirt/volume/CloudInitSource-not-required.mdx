- `meta_data` (\*string) - [optional] NoCloud instance metadata as string.
  If not present, a default one will be generated with the instance-id set to the same value as the domain name
  If you want to set network config, see the `network_config` attribute

- `user_data` (\*string) - [optional] CloudInit user-data as string.
  See [cloud-init documentation](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/format.html) for more

- `network_config` (\*string) - [optional] Network configuration for cloud-init to be picked up.
  User-data cannot change an instance’s network configuration.
  In the absence of network configuration in any sources,
  Cloud-init will write out a network configuration that will issue a DHCP request on a “first” network interface.
  Read more about the possible format and features at
  [cloud-init documentation](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/network-config.html).
